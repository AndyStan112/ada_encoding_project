This is a WIP solution for the ADA encoding assignment.
It currently implements STATIC Huffman encoding and decoding.

TODO:

- to implement dynamic huffman encoding
- to add benchmarking

To compile:
`make`

To use:
`huff -c|-d <input_file> <output_file>`

Recommended big text files for testing(funilly enough the first entry is titled AdA) :
https://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata.html

Compressing and decompressing the above file(s) yields the same sha256sum
